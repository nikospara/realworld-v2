/**
 * Service interfaces and supporting data types describing the application.
 * <p>
 * The intention of these classes is to capture an architecture level view of the application functionalities.
 * It is not a requirement to implement these service interfaces in the application, as long as any implementation
 * remains compatible with them.
 * <p>
 * One idea where implementing the service interfaces here would be useful is to create E2E tests,
 * where these interfaces describe the business objects and they may be implemented e.g. with Selenium.
