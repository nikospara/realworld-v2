/**
 * Architectural level model for the first version of the application.
 * <p>
 * <em>Clarification about versions:</em> The entire application is called Realworld-v2, in reference to
 * the "v1" <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld">Realworld Application</a> and
 * the fact that we are re-imagining the API and extending its functionality, hence "v2".
 * In the context of the "Realworld-v2" application, the API is still versioned starting from
 * version 1. So the {@code realworld.v1} package pertains to the first version of the reimagined,
 * "Realworld-v2" application.
